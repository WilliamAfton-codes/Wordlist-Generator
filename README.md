# Wordlist-Generator
Generates random alphanumeric strings with capital and lowercase letters and saves them to wordlist.txt for all your brute-forcing needs

# Usage
~~Make sure you have the empty wordlist.txt file in the same directory/folder as wordlistgen.py~~ (Fixed in latest release)

Run `wordlistgen.py` and input amount of strings to generate

Strings will generate and be saved in a newly created `wordlist.txt`

(Optional build from source [here](guide/BFS.md))
